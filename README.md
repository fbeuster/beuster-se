# beuster{se} CMS

Since 2010 I developed constantly on my blog software, adding
features, restructuring and so on. Now I finally moved it to git as the next
step.

Currently it's not well build and not object oriented, which is why I would
not recommend to use it for now. But of course yo can, if you ready to put some
work in it.
Be aware that there are still some parts for [my blog](http://beusterse.de)
hardcoded.

Over the next ~~weeks~~ months I will transform the system step by step, so once it's
finished it should be totally oo-Style and usable for everyone.
A code documentation can be found under [doc.beusterse.de](http://doc.beusterse.de)
